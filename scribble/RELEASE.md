# Scribble Release Process

This repo uses semantic versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.

1. **Alert others you are releasing**

   There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start
   a release, alert others so that they don't accidentally merge
   anything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.

1. **Push a git tag**

   The tag should be of the format `release-N.M.L`, ex `git tag release-3.7.1; git push origin release-3.7.1`.

1. **Wait for Travis CI**

   This part is controlled by [`travis/publish.sh`](travis/publish.sh). It creates a bunch of new commits, bumps
   the version, publishes artifacts, and syncs to Maven Central.
